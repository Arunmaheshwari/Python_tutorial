# Arithimetic Operator
# print('4+5 is', 4+5)
# print('4-5 is', 4-5)
# print('4*5 is', 4*5)
# print('4/5 is', 4/5)
#
# print('18//5 is', 18//5) # It will print only floor value
# print('5**3 is ', 5**3) # it will print as exponential
# print('5 % 3 is ', 5 %3) # it will print only reminder

#Assignment Operator
# x = 5
# print(x)
# x+=4
# print(x)
# x-=3
# print(x)
# x*=2
# print(x)
# x/=2
# print(x)
# x%=5
# print(x)

# Comparison Operator
# i = 5
# print(i == 5)
# print(i!= 5)
# print(i<5)
# print(i>5)
# print(i<=5)

# Logical Operator

# i = True
# j = False
# print(i and j)
# print(i or j)



#Identity Operator
# print(5 is 5)
# print(5 is not 5)


# Mebership Operator
# list1 = [3,4,6,5,8,1,2,56,76]
# print(5 in list1)
# print(123 in list1)
# print(123 not in list1)

# Bitwise Operator
# numbers in bits
# 0 = 00
# 1 = 01
# 2 = 10
# 3 = 11
